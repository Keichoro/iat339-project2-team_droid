Questions for prof tomorrow:
1. Which pages do you think are the most important to work on and meet the criteria?

-company updates/events
-about the company
-how to contact the business
-a multi-product listing
-one product detailed view
-the entire process of purchasing a product
-appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product

2. Ask about the logo design. Should it stand out more to look like a button?

3. Ask about the breadcrumbs. Should each step be clickable and linked to each step? If so, would that make the back and next buttons useless?

4. Opinion about using a subpage header or section header.

5. Clarify that all fonts chosen for this project must be downloaded.

6. Use darker colors for the banner?
