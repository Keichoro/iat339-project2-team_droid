RENTING PAGES:

careful with credit card img stacking

header height --> fix

padding/margin:weird spacing

font consistency --> sans-serif/serif

collapsing steps into numbers
	-not ideal
	-change words to condense (payment->pay, legal)


back/forward buttons

next button too far --> need to clarify with proximity

collapse a- alignment

Built-in calendar form field --> chrome and iOS has some bugs

fix padding in mobile version

Rent-a-friend-list
	-need a cue that area is interactive to check the check box
	-too much space for checkbox, and not enough for text ~330px
	-padding text and image too cozy at times
	-add line length cap

Set of options
Fix proximity of numbers and text

Return button --> more specific to rent a friend for rent-template.html

HTML Shiv --polyfills load up library tell what need to polyfill --> uses javascript
	-eg. webshim

Register padding of button
--> need button style similar (doesn't fit set)

Submit & register --> straight to profile page

Condense pages --> dont need so many pages

Rating --> circular elements not seen before --> doesn't complement other elements
- consistency of leave a review to complement other buttons

-overlapping and positiong, confusing (left alignment causes unclear hierarchy) --> fix line alignment

-get rid of calendar and events pages!!



-Readability of header nav links hard to read
-Chum Buddies logo ---> doesn't need to be in a different color box

Latest news
--> give them activity, add a fake link
--> christmas take to profile
--> reorganize at big width
